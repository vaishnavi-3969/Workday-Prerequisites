# Getting started with Java
- Overview
- The features of the java programming language
- The java platform
- JDK
- Java class and "main" method
- Java API Documentation (Javadocs)
# Introduction to Objects
- OOP
- OBjects vs. primitives
- Objects vs. primitive addendum
- stack and heap
- using objects
- initializing data
- creating object types
- "void"
- building constructors
- constructors and default values
- default vs. 'no-arg' constructor
- initialization blocks
- introduction to objects lab
# Static, scope and garbage collection
- static variables
- static methods
- static reference variables and null
- static initialization block
- 'this'
- scope
- garbage collection
- java memory leaks
- static lab
# Packages
- packages and imports
- classpath
- JARs
- Packages lab
# Java Conventions and Primitives
- coding standards
- comments
- javadoc
- identifiders and comments
- primitive data types
- primitive literals
- primitive conversion

# Java Syntax
- conditional - if/else
- switch
- operators
- loops
- break, continue and labels
- enumerations(enum)
# Strings
- string objects
- string operations and operators
- immutable strings
- concatentation operator
- working with strings
- pass by value: primitives
- pass by value: objects
- passing by value 
# Encapsulation
- encapsulation and data hiding
- getters and setters
- access modifiers
# Inheritance
- chaining constructors
- more on 'protected'
- super and the first statement rule
- overloading methods
- overriding methods
- covariants returns
- the 3 faces of final
- revisiting switch statement
- class/object invocation order
# Polymorphism
- being available vs. being inside
- benefits
- object type casting
- the object class
# Abstract class and interfaces
- abstract methods: modifiers and inheritance
- all interface methods are 'public'
# Lambda expression and static imports
- marker and functional interfaces
- lambda expressions
- static imports
# Dates and Time
- localdate
- localTime, localDateTime and Period
- DateTimeFormatter
- Dates and Time Lab
# Arrays
- polymorphism revisted
- multi-dimensional arrays
- sorting and searching arrays
- common array mistakes
- varargs
# Collections
- when arrays aren't enough
- the collection interface
- iterator
- lists
- sets
- queues
- deques
- maps
# More with collections
- limitations of collections
- revisiting overloading methods: order of precedence
- generics and autoboxing
- diamond operator
- bulding a list from Arrays.asList and Anonymous Arrays
- Sorting and searching collections
- comparable
- comparator
- type parameters and comparable/comparator
# Exception handling
- throwable
- catching exceptions
- finally block
- the exception object
- unchecked (runtime) vs. checked exceptions
- creating exceptions
