# Section 1: Getting Started

- React is a JS library for building UI

- in react js we are writing code in a declarative way not imperative code
- React uses javascript under the hSood to update the UI

# Section 2: JavaScript Refresher

defer â†’ ensures that the js file is executed only after the html is loaded
alternatively we can add script tag at the end of body section
type="module" -> import
- React projects use a build process
	- the code you write isn't the code that gets executed (like this) in the browser
	- Your code is transformed before it's handed off to the browser
	- we can see that tool in the package.json file
	- lists all the dependencies and libraries used by the project
	- your code is transformed before it's handed off to the browser
1. Raw, unprocessed React code won't execute in the browser -> jSx isn't a default js feature
	- jsx -> html code written in js file
2. In addition, the code wouldn't be optimized for production (eg. not minified)
		- react projects require a build process that transform our code
		- create-react-app, vite etc. give us such a build process (no custom setup or tweaking needed)
### import and export
- only 1 default export per file
- import * as utils from './utils.js';
- we can add alias to anything we are importing
### revisiting values and variables
- string, number, boolean, null and undefined

additional -> objects
- variables store alues

camelcase
let, const
const -> mustn't be redefined
### revisiting operators
+,-,* , /, ===
### Revisiting functions and parameters
code that's not executed immediately but whenever we want
`function greet() {`
	`console.log("hello world")`
`}`
`greet()`
- parameters
- functions must only have one return stmt at most
- function w/o 'return' implicitly return 'undefined'
- 
### More on arrow function syntax

### arrays and arrays methods like map()
### destructuring
### destructuring in function parameter lists
### the spread operator
### revisiting control structures
### maniupulating the dom - not with react
### using functions as values
### defining functions inside of functions
### reference vs primitive values
### next-gen js - summary
### js array functions
### module resources
